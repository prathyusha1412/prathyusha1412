## Featured Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm particularly proud of:

1. Airfare Price Prediction.
Components: Google Collab, Python, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Power Point.
‚Ä¢ Enhanced an existing flight price dataset by adding related features for analysis. This unique dataset improved the accuracy of flight price predictions using regression and classification models to understand how the price of the airline ticket varies based on the conditions.
‚Ä¢ The study aimed to determine the most effective algorithms for predicting flight prices and price ranges while identifying key features along with some visualizations to depict which factors significantly impact these predictions.

2. Optimization of Outpatient Clinic Processes through Simulation.
Components: SIMUL8.
‚Ä¢ This project aims to optimize the operational processes of an outpatient clinic using SIMUL8 software to identify areas for improvement and propose strategies for enhancing overall performance. The focus is on addressing common issues such as prolonged patient wait times, resource underutilization, and administrative bottlenecks to improve clinic efficiency and patient satisfaction.
‚Ä¢ By conducting a comprehensive analysis and simulating the clinic's processes from patient registration to checkout, the project seeks to provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to clinic stakeholders. These insights are intended to streamline workflows, optimize resource allocation, and create a more efficient, responsive, and patient-centered outpatient clinic environment.

3. Tiny Tap.
Components: Microsoft Project.
‚Ä¢ This project involves developing the Tiny Tap URL shortener system, which caters to social media influencers, marketing professionals, and general users by offering not only URL shortening but also comprehensive analytics. The system tracks metrics such as click counts, browser types, geographical locations, device types, and access times, providing users with valuable insights into audience behavior, which can be used to optimize content strategies and marketing campaigns.
‚Ä¢ We created a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), a Resource Sheet, and a Gantt Chart in Microsoft Project to track and monitor the project's progress, ensuring it meets all timelines and stays within budget. This comprehensive approach helps in effectively managing resources, deadlines, and costs throughout the project's lifecycle.

4. Design of automotive vehicles based on fog density.
Components: Arduino, Sensors, IoT Module, Motors, Wheels, App, Mobile.
‚Ä¢ Analyzed the current issues of the drivers while driving a vehicle in the adverse weather conditions like dense fog or heavy rain or snow and designed a sensor system that would be clipped on to the vehicle which would calculate the current outside temperature, humidity, dew point temperature, fog density, and relative humidity.
‚Ä¢ Based on the incoming values from the sensor and if the dew point falls below a certain threshold limit the sensor notifies through the IoT module to the Mobile App and cloud as well as the vehicle motor control unit that the fog is expected in the current conditions and based on that it helps to maintain the acceleration of the vehicle within safe limits.
